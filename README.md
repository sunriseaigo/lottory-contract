# Casino Simple Contract

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample casino contract, a test for that contract on Amoy testnet, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract and verify contract with etherscan.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat run --network mumbai scripts/deploy.js
npx hardhat verify --network etherscan {contract deployed address}
```
